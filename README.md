LED Display Controller using an Atmel Microcontroller

The display case light controller controls the brightness of an LED (or any other light) using a ATMega328P	and a ATtiny13A. 
The controller sports an on-off switch to control the state of the display as well as 
three push buttons to select the colour you wish to display (from a
combination of red, green and blue). 

The LCD Display shows the brightness of the colours, as well as the on/off state.
